# The Code Bytes

Thecodebytes was originally created with the intent of helping both new and experienced programmers on their path of continuous learning and improvement. It was also a way to learn and grow as a developer myself. Today, I hope to use thecodebytes to teach developers new tricks and how they can monetize their skills.

In other words, thecodebytes is a platform to help creatives grow and make a living off their craft.
